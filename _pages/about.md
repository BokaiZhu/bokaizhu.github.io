I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Ragon Institute at MGH, MIT, and Harvard, supervised by Prof. [Alex Shalek](https://shaleklab.com/). Prior to that, I obtained my PhD degree in Microbiology and Immunology from Stanford University, under the supervision of Prof. [Garry Nolan](https://web.stanford.edu/group/nolan/index.html). I received my bachelor’s degree in biology from Cornell University and Zhejiang Univeristy.

Research Interest
======
My doctoral research focused on:

* Experimental assay development for multiplex imaging platforms
* Computational algorithm development for single-cell multi-omic integrations
* Application of the above tools in biological systems (e.g., Microbiome, Cancer, Infectious disease)
